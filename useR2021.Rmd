## Everything seemed to work but...

# We faced some issues

<br><br>
- ** Trained members moved away following their careers (The cycle was difficult to maintain). ** <br><br><br>
- ** Communities work with voluntaries (we needed more of them). ** <br><br><br>
- ** New members were not taking opportunities due to language barriers. ** <br><br><br>
